# Rustloader Security Best Practices Guide

This guide outlines security recommendations for using Rustloader safely and protecting your system from potential security risks.

## Installation Security

### Verify Installation Sources

- **Always download Rustloader from official sources** (official website or GitHub repository)
- **Verify checksums** after downloading using the following command:
  ```bash
  sha256sum rustloader-<version>.tar.gz
  ```
  Compare the output with the published checksums on the official website.
- **Use the provided secure installation script** instead of manual installation when possible
- **Inspect installation scripts** before running them if you're security-conscious

### Secure Installation Options

Use our enhanced secure installation script with additional security features:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibra2000sd/rustloader/main/secure_install.sh | bash
```

For maximum security, download, inspect, and then run the script:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibra2000sd/rustloader/main/secure_install.sh
# Inspect the script content
chmod +x secure_install.sh
./secure_install.sh
```

## Regular Updates

### Keep Dependencies Updated

- **Update yt-dlp regularly** to receive security patches:
  ```bash
  yt-dlp --update
  ```
- **Update ffmpeg** using your system's package manager
- **Check for Rustloader updates** by running:
  ```bash
  rustloader --version
  ```
  Compare with the latest version on our website.

### Automatic Security Auditing

Rustloader includes the ability to check its dependencies for security issues. Run the following periodically:

```bash
# Coming in a future update
rustloader --security-audit
```

## Safe Operation

### URL Security

- **Only download from trusted sources** and websites you are familiar with
- **Avoid downloading from suspicious URLs** or URLs shared through untrusted channels
- **Do not use Rustloader with URLs containing unusual characters** or encoding patterns
- **Be cautious with shortened URLs** - they may hide malicious destinations

### File Security

- **Set up a dedicated download directory** with appropriate permissions:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/Downloads/rustloader
  chmod 700 ~/Downloads/rustloader
  ```
- **Scan downloaded files with antivirus software** before opening them
- **Review files before opening**, especially executable or script files
- **Never run downloaded executable files** without verifying their authenticity

### Content Security

- **Be mindful of content licensing** - downloading copyrighted content may be illegal in your jurisdiction
- **Respect platform terms of service** - excessive downloading may result in your IP being blocked
- **Consider using a VPN** for privacy, but be aware of legal implications

## System Security

### User Permissions

- **Avoid running Rustloader with root/administrator privileges** unless absolutely necessary
- **Use a standard user account** for all normal downloading operations
- **Apply the principle of least privilege** - only give applications the permissions they need

### Network Security

- **Consider using a firewall** to monitor and control Rustloader's network access
- **Monitor bandwidth usage** to detect unusual activity
- **Use a private network** rather than public Wi-Fi when possible

### Data Protection

- **Regularly clean up temporary files**:
  ```bash
  rustloader --cleanup
  ```
- **Limit daily downloads** to prevent abuse (Free version does this automatically)
- **Set up download quotas** if sharing Rustloader on a multi-user system

## Advanced Security Measures

### Containerization

For maximum security, consider running Rustloader in a container:

```bash
# Install Docker if not already installed
# Then create a Rustloader container
docker run -v ~/Downloads:/downloads -it --rm alpine sh -c "apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip ffmpeg && pip3 install rustloader && rustloader URL -o /downloads"
```

### Network Isolation

Use network namespaces or VLANs to isolate Rustloader's network access:

```bash
# Create a separate network namespace
sudo ip netns add rustloader_ns

# Run Rustloader in that namespace
sudo ip netns exec rustloader_ns sudo -u $USER rustloader URL
```

## Troubleshooting Security Issues

### Recognizing Security Problems

Signs that may indicate security issues:

- Unexpected or excessive network activity
- System slowdowns during usage
- Files appearing in unexpected locations
- Permission errors in unexpected locations
- Antivirus alerts related to Rustloader operations

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Rustloader:

1. **Do not post it publicly** - responsible disclosure helps protect all users
2. **Email security@rustloader.com** with details
3. **Include steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
4. **Wait for a response** before disclosing publicly

## License Security

### Protecting Your License

- **Store license files securely** - they contain unique identifiers tied to your account
- **Do not share your license key** - sharing may result in license revocation
- **Report lost or stolen keys** immediately to prevent unauthorized use

### Verifying License Authenticity

Verify your license status and authenticity:

```bash
rustloader --license
```
